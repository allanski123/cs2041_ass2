                                                       but very basic at the moment. Need to think about structure more and how I will redirect pages.

Goal:                    
1) Finish levels 0-2 minimum 
2) Try to implement as many level 3 as I can
3) I would try to finish all levels - but making choice to put aside time to study for finals
